# dessert-bloom
🍨 Proud to share a dessert website I designed and developed from scratch! 🎉

This project is a fully front-end web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focused on delivering an elegant and seamless user experience for dessert lovers.

🔧 Key Highlights:

Professionally crafted UI/UX design for an inviting and modern look

Interactive order form for a smooth customer journey

Responsive layout optimized for all devices

Clean, maintainable code with a focus on accessibility and usability

Smooth transitions and animations for visual appeal

As both the designer and developer, I focused on translating aesthetic vision into functional design, ensuring the site is not just beautiful but also intuitive and efficient to use.

This project deepened my skills in front-end development and user-centered design, and I'm excited to share it with the community!
